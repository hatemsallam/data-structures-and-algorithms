# Graphs
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

## Challenge
Implementing Graph Data structure.

## Approach & Efficiency
Implemented the graph and held the nodes of it into a hash map with type T (Generic), and Another Hash map
of type T, Integer(For the weight).
## API
Class Graph :
- Member Variables:
  - Hash map nodes<T , <HashMap<T , Integer>>>
- Methods :
  - addNode(T node) : adds a node to the graph (no edges specified yet).
  - addEdge(T sourceNode , T destinationNode , int weight) : adds an edge between two nodes.
  - getNodes() : returns All nodes in a graph.
  - getNeighbours(T node) : returns all neighbours of a specific graph.
  - getSize() : returns the size of the graph.
