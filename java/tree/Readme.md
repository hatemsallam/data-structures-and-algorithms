# Trees
Binary Tree and BST Implementation



## Challenge 15
Binary Search Tree
- create a Binary Search Tree class
- create Add methode adds a new node with a value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- create Contains methode that takes a value and return boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least


## Approach & Efficiency
- Time complexity O(log(n))
- Space O(1)




# Challenge 16
Find the Maximum Value in a Binary search Tree

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
- Time complexity O(log(n))
- Space O(1)



# Challenge 17
- Breadth-first Traversal.
Write a function called breadth first that takes a tree as an input and
return a list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered

## Approach & Efficiency
- Time complexity O(n)
- Space O(2*n)
